## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Database Setup

**Quick Method** (Recommended):
1. Open `documents/setup-events.sql`
2. Copy entire contents
3. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
4. Run the script
5. Verify results

**Prerequisites**:
- ✅ `users` table must exist
- ✅ `organizations` table must exist
- ✅ `organization_members` table must exist

### Step 2: Backend Verification

The backend code is already in place. No additional setup needed.

### Step 3: Test the API

Test endpoints:
```bash
# Get all events
GET /api/event

# Get upcoming events
GET /api/event?upcoming=true&limit=10

# Create an event
POST /api/event
{
  "event_name": "Team Meeting",
  "date": "2025-11-15T14:00:00.000Z",
  "organization_id": "org-uuid",
  "description": "Weekly sync",
  "location": "Room 101"
}

# Update an event
PUT /api/event/[id]
{
  "location": "Room 202"
}

# Delete an event
DELETE /api/event/[id]
```

### Step 4: Optional - Add Test Data

1. Open `documents/test-data-events.sql`
2. Replace placeholder UUIDs with actual IDs
3. Run script to populate sample events

## 🔑 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Permission |
|--------|----------|-------------|------------|
| GET | `/api/event` | List all user events | Member+ |
| GET | `/api/event?upcoming=true` | Get upcoming events | Member+ |
| GET | `/api/event?past=true` | Get past events | Member+ |
| GET | `/api/event?search=term` | Search events | Member+ |
| POST | `/api/event` | Create new event | Attendance Taker+ |
| GET | `/api/event/[id]` | Get event details | Member+ |
| GET | `/api/event/[id]?details=true` | Get event with full details | Member+ |
| PUT | `/api/event/[id]` | Update event | Attendance Taker+ |
| DELETE | `/api/event/[id]` | Delete event | Admin+ |
| GET | `/api/organization/[id]/events` | List organization events | Member+ |

---

## 🔐 Database Schema

### Events Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  event_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  date TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  organization_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES organizations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  description TEXT,
  location TEXT,
  created_by UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Indexes (6 total)

1. `idx_events_organization_id` - Organization lookups
2. `idx_events_date` - Date filtering
3. `idx_events_created_by` - Creator lookups
4. `idx_events_created_at` - Creation time sorting
5. `idx_events_name` - Name searches
6. `idx_events_org_date` - Composite for common queries

### RLS Policies (4 total)

1. **SELECT** - Members can view events in their organizations
2. **INSERT** - Authorized roles can create events
3. **UPDATE** - Authorized roles can update events
4. **DELETE** - Admins can delete events

## 🎨 Architecture

### Service Layer Pattern

```typescript
EventService
  ├── createEvent(userId, input)
  ├── getEventById(userId, eventId)
  ├── getEventWithDetails(userId, eventId)
  ├── getUserEvents(userId, filters?)
  ├── getOrganizationEvents(userId, orgId, filters?)
  ├── updateEvent(userId, eventId, input)
  ├── deleteEvent(userId, eventId)
  ├── getUpcomingEvents(userId, limit?)
  └── getPastEvents(userId, limit?)
```

### API Route Structure

```
/api/
  ├── event/
  │   ├── route.ts (GET all, POST create)
  │   └── [id]/
  │       └── route.ts (GET, PUT, DELETE)
  └── organization/
      └── [id]/
          └── events/
              └── route.ts (GET org events)
```

### Type System

```typescript
Event                   // Base event interface
EventWithOrganization   // Event + org details
EventWithDetails        // Event + org + creator details
CreateEventInput        // Creation payload
UpdateEventInput        // Update payload
EventFilters           // Query filters
```

## 🔄 Rollback Instructions

If you need to rollback changes:

### Rollback Individual Commits

```bash
# Rollback last commit
git revert HEAD

# Rollback specific commit
git revert <commit-hash>

# Rollback multiple commits
git revert HEAD~3..HEAD
```

### Remove Database Objects

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Drop policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Members can view organization events" ON events;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authorized members can create events" ON events;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authorized members can update events" ON events;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Owners and Admins can delete events" ON events;

-- Drop trigger
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS update_events_updated_at ON events;

-- Drop table (includes indexes)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS events CASCADE;
```
