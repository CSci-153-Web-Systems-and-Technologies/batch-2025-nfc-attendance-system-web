- ✅ Organization and OrganizationMember interfaces
- ✅ OrganizationRole type (Owner, Admin, Attendance Taker, Member)
- ✅ ROLE_PERMISSIONS matrix
- ✅ Input types for all operations
- ✅ Helper function: `hasPermission()`

### 2. Service Layer (`src/lib/services/organization.service.ts`)
**Organization Management:**
- ✅ `createOrganization()` - Creates org with automatic owner assignment

- ✅ `transferOwnership()` - Transfer ownership to another member

**Member Management:**
- ✅ `addMember()` - Add member with role
- ✅ `getOrganizationMembers()` - List all members with user details
- ✅ `getMember()` - Get specific member
- ✅ `updateMemberRole()` - Change member's role
- ✅ `removeMember()` - Remove member from org
- ✅ `isMember()` - Check membership
- ✅ `getUserRole()` - Get user's role in org

### 3. Authorization Utilities (`src/lib/authorization.ts`)
- ✅ `requireOrgPermission()` - Check specific permission
- ✅ `requireOrgOwner()` - Owner-only check
- ✅ `requireOrgMembership()` - Member access check
- ✅ `requireOrgRole()` - Specific role check
- ✅ `isAuthorized()` - Type guard helper
- ✅ `AuthorizationContext` interface

### 4. API Routes

**Organization Endpoints:**

- ✅ `GET /api/organization/[id]` - Get organization details
- ✅ `PUT /api/organization/[id]` - Update organization (Owner/Admin)
- ✅ `DELETE /api/organization/[id]` - Delete organization (Owner only)

**Member Management Endpoints:**
- ✅ `GET /api/organization/[id]/members` - List all members
- ✅ `POST /api/organization/[id]/members` - Add member (Owner/Admin)
- ✅ `GET /api/organization/[id]/members/[userId]` - Get member details
- ✅ `PATCH /api/organization/[id]/members/[userId]` - Update role (Owner/Admin)
- ✅ `DELETE /api/organization/[id]/members/[userId]` - Remove member (Owner/Admin)

**Special Endpoints:**

## 🎯 Role Permissions Implemented

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full control: manage org, delete org, manage members, manage events, take attendance, view attendance |

- ✅ Validation on all inputs

## 🗄️ Database Schema

**Tables Created:**
1. `organizations` - Stores organization details
2. `organization_members` - Junction table with roles

**Features:**

- ✅ Timestamps (created_at, updated_at) with auto-update triggers
- ✅ Indexes for performance optimization
- ✅ Foreign key relationships to users table
- ✅ Check constraints for valid roles

## 🚀 Next Steps - Action Required

### 1. Set Up Supabase Database

**IMPORTANT:** You need to run the SQL setup in Supabase:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Open `documents/ORGANIZATION_BACKEND_SETUP.md`
4. Copy the "Complete Setup Script" section
5. Paste and run it in the SQL Editor
6. Verify with the verification queries at the end

This will create:
- `organizations` table
- `organization_members` table
- All indexes
- RLS policies
- Trigger functions

### 2. Test the API

After database setup, test the endpoints:

```bash
# 1. Create an organization
POST /api/organization
Body: { "name": "Test Org", "description": "Testing" }

# 2. List your organizations
GET /api/organization

# 3. Add a member
POST /api/organization/[id]/members
Body: { "email": "member@example.com", "role": "Member" }

# 4. List members
GET /api/organization/[id]/members
```

### 3. Merge to Develop

Once tested:

```bash
git checkout develop
git merge feature/organization-backend
git push origin develop
```

## ✨ Features Ready for Events Module

The organization backend is now ready to support:
- Event creation (by Owners/Admins)
- Event management (by Owners/Admins)
- Attendance taking (by Owners/Admins/Attendance Takers)
- Attendance viewing (by all members)

Each event will reference an organization_id and respect the role permissions defined here.
