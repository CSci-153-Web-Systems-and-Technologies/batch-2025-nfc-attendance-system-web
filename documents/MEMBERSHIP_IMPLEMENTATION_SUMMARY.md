## ‚ú® Key Features

### Role-Based Access Control
- **Owner** (Level 4) - Full control, can transfer ownership
- **Admin** (Level 3) - Manage members and events
- **Attendance Taker** (Level 2) - Take attendance
- **Member** (Level 1) - Basic access

### Permission Hierarchy
The system enforces a hierarchical permission model where higher roles inherit permissions from lower roles.

### Membership Tags
Each membership can be represented as a tag in the format `OrganizationName:Role` (e.g., "FOC:Admin", "CSC:Member").

### Security Features
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Protected Owner role (cannot be directly modified)
- Cascade deletes for data integrity
- Users can leave organizations (except Owners)
- Permission checks at both API and service layers

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Table: `organization_members`

```sql
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- user_id (UUID, Foreign Key -> users)
- organization_id (UUID, Foreign Key -> organizations)
- role (TEXT, CHECK: Owner, Admin, Attendance Taker, Member)
- joined_at (TIMESTAMP)
- updated_at (TIMESTAMP)
- UNIQUE(user_id, organization_id)
```

### Indexes
- `idx_organization_members_user_id`
- `idx_organization_members_organization_id`
- `idx_organization_members_role`
- `idx_organization_members_joined_at`
- `idx_organization_members_user_org` (composite)
- `idx_organization_members_org_role` (composite)

### Triggers
- `update_organization_members_updated_at` - Auto-update timestamp
- `check_single_owner_trigger` - Enforce one owner per org

### RLS Policies
- Users can view their own memberships
- Users can view org memberships they belong to
- Admins/Owners can add members
- Admins/Owners can update memberships (except Owner)
- Admins/Owners can remove members (except Owner)
- Users can leave organizations (except Owner)

### Helper Functions

- `user_has_permission(user_id, org_id, required_role)` - Check permission level
- `get_organization_member_count(org_id)` - Count members
- `get_user_membership_count(user_id)` - Count user's memberships
- `get_user_role_in_organization(user_id, org_id)` - Get role

## üîß Service Methods

### CRUD Operations
- `createMembership(input)`
- `getMembershipById(id)`
- `getMembershipWithOrganization(id)`
- `getMembershipWithUser(id)`
- `getMembershipWithDetails(id)`
- `updateMembership(id, input)`
- `deleteMembership(id)`

### Query Operations
- `getMemberships(filters?)`
- `getUserMemberships(userId)`
- `getOrganizationMembers(orgId)`
- `getUserMembershipInOrganization(userId, orgId)`
- `countMemberships(filters?)`

### Permission Operations
- `userHasRole(userId, orgId, role)`

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Set Up Database (5 minutes)
Run the SQL setup script in Supabase SQL Editor:
```bash
# Copy contents of documents/setup-membership.sql
# Paste and run in Supabase SQL Editor
```

### 2. Verify Setup (1 minute)
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM organization_members;
```

### 3. Test API (2 minutes)
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/membership/user/your-user-id" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### 4. Add Test Data (Optional)
```bash
# Use documents/test-data-membership.sql
# Replace UUIDs with actual values from your database
```

## üß™ Testing

### Unit Tests Needed (TODO)
- [ ] MembershipService methods
- [ ] API endpoint responses
- [ ] Permission checks
- [ ] RLS policies

### Integration Tests Needed (TODO)
- [ ] End-to-end membership creation
- [ ] Role updates
- [ ] Ownership transfer
- [ ] Member removal

## üîí Security Considerations

1. **Authentication Required** - All endpoints require valid auth token
2. **Authorization Enforced** - Role-based access at API and DB levels
3. **Owner Protection** - Owner role cannot be directly modified
4. **Cascade Deletes** - Orphan prevention
5. **RLS Policies** - Database-level security

## üéØ Use Cases

### 1. Add Member to Organization
```typescript
const membership = await MembershipService.createMembership({
  user_id: 'user-uuid',
  organization_id: 'org-uuid',
  role: 'Member'
})
```

### 2. Check User Permission
```typescript
const hasAccess = await MembershipService.userHasPermission(
  'user-uuid',
  'org-uuid',
  'Admin'
)
```

### 3. Get Membership Tags
```typescript
const tags = await MembershipService.getUserMembershipTags('user-uuid')
// Result: [{ organization_name: 'FOC', role: 'Admin', tag: 'FOC:Admin' }]
```

### 4. Transfer Ownership
```typescript
await MembershipService.transferOwnership(
  'org-uuid',
  'current-owner-uuid',
  'new-owner-uuid'
)
```

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Cannot create membership
**Solution**: Ensure user is Admin or Owner of the organization

### Issue: Cannot assign Owner role
**Solution**: Use transfer ownership endpoint instead

### Issue: Cannot view memberships
**Solution**: Check RLS policies and user authentication

### Issue: Multiple owners created
**Solution**: Verify single owner trigger is active

## üìà Performance Optimizations

- **Indexes**: All foreign keys and common queries indexed
- **Composite Indexes**: User-org and org-role queries optimized
- **Views**: Optional pre-joined views for common queries
- **Helper Functions**: Cached permission checks

## üîÑ Integration Points

### With Organization Feature
- Organizations automatically create owner membership
- Ownership changes update both tables
- Organization deletion cascades to memberships

### With User Feature
- User profile includes membership tags
- User deletion cascades to memberships
- User permissions based on memberships

### With Events Feature (Future)
- Attendance takers can manage event attendance
- Members can view events
- Role-based event access control
