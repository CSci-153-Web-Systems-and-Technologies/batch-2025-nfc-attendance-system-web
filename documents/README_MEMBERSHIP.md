# 📋 Membership Backend Feature - Complete Package

## Overview

The **Membership Backend** feature manages user-organization relationships with role-based access control. Each membership acts as a "tag" connecting users to organizations with specific roles (e.g., `FOC:Admin`, `CSC:Member`).

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1️⃣ Set Up Database (5 minutes)

Copy and run the complete SQL setup in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```bash
📄 documents/setup-membership.sql
```

This creates:
- ✅ `organization_members` table
- ✅ Indexes for performance
- ✅ RLS policies for security
- ✅ Triggers and constraints
- ✅ Helper functions

### 2️⃣ Test the API (2 minutes)

```bash
# Get your memberships
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/membership/user/{userId}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Get membership tags
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/membership/user/{userId}/tags" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### 3️⃣ Add Test Data (Optional)

Use the test data script:
```bash
📄 documents/test-data-membership.sql
```

## 🎯 Core Concepts

### Role Hierarchy

```
Owner (Level 4)
  └─ Can transfer ownership, delete org
     └─ Admin (Level 3)
         └─ Can manage members & events
            └─ Attendance Taker (Level 2)
                └─ Can take attendance
                   └─ Member (Level 1)
                       └─ Basic access
```

### Membership Tags

Each membership is represented as: `OrganizationName:Role`

**Examples:**
- `Faculty of Computing:Admin`
- `Computer Science Club:Member`
- `Math Club:Attendance Taker`

---

## 🔌 API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/membership` | GET | List memberships (with filters) |
| `/api/membership` | POST | Create membership |
| `/api/membership/{id}` | GET | Get membership details |
| `/api/membership/{id}` | PATCH | Update role |
| `/api/membership/{id}` | DELETE | Remove member |
| `/api/membership/user/{userId}` | GET | User's memberships |
| `/api/membership/user/{userId}/tags` | GET | Membership tags |
| `/api/membership/organization/{orgId}` | GET | Organization members |
| `/api/membership/transfer-ownership` | POST | Transfer ownership |

**📖 Full details:** [API Reference](./MEMBERSHIP_API_REFERENCE.md)

---

## 💻 Usage Examples

### Add a Member

```typescript
import { MembershipService } from '@/lib/services/membership.service'

const membership = await MembershipService.createMembership({
  user_id: 'user-uuid',
  organization_id: 'org-uuid',
  role: 'Member'
})
```

### Check Permissions

```typescript
const hasAccess = await MembershipService.userHasPermission(
  'user-uuid',
  'org-uuid',
  'Admin'
)
```

### Get Membership Tags

```typescript
const tags = await MembershipService.getUserMembershipTags('user-uuid')
// Result: [{ organization_name: 'FOC', role: 'Admin', tag: 'FOC:Admin' }]
```

### Transfer Ownership

```typescript
await MembershipService.transferOwnership(
  'org-uuid',
  'current-owner-uuid',
  'new-owner-uuid'
)
```

**📖 More examples:** [Feature Summary](./MEMBERSHIP_FEATURE_SUMMARY.md)

---

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Table: `organization_members`

```sql
id                UUID PRIMARY KEY
user_id           UUID REFERENCES users(id)
organization_id   UUID REFERENCES organizations(id)
role              TEXT CHECK (Owner|Admin|Attendance Taker|Member)
joined_at         TIMESTAMP
updated_at        TIMESTAMP
UNIQUE (user_id, organization_id)
```

### Security Features

✅ **Row Level Security (RLS)** - 6 policies  
✅ **Single Owner Constraint** - Enforced by trigger  
✅ **Cascade Deletes** - Automatic cleanup  
✅ **Permission Checks** - Role hierarchy validation  

**📖 Full schema:** [Backend Setup](./MEMBERSHIP_BACKEND_SETUP.md)

---

## 🔒 Security & Permissions

### Authorization Rules

1. ✅ **Owner** - Full control, can transfer ownership
2. ✅ **Admin** - Can add/remove members, update roles
3. ✅ **Attendance Taker** - Can take attendance
4. ✅ **Member** - Basic access, can leave org

### Protected Operations

- ❌ Cannot directly assign Owner role (use transfer endpoint)
- ❌ Cannot remove Owner (must transfer first)
- ✅ Users can always leave organizations (except Owners)
- ✅ Higher roles inherit lower role permissions

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Verify Setup

```sql
-- Check table exists
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM organization_members;

-- Check RLS policies
SELECT policyname FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'organization_members';

-- Check triggers
SELECT trigger_name FROM information_schema.triggers 
WHERE event_object_table = 'organization_members';
```

### Test API

```bash
# Test creating membership
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/membership" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  -d '{"user_id":"uuid","organization_id":"uuid","role":"Member"}'

# Test getting memberships
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/membership/user/uuid" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Cannot create membership | Check if user is Admin/Owner |
| Cannot assign Owner role | Use transfer ownership endpoint |
| Cannot view memberships | Verify authentication and RLS policies |
| Multiple owners error | Single owner trigger is active |

**📖 Full troubleshooting:** [Backend Setup](./MEMBERSHIP_BACKEND_SETUP.md)
